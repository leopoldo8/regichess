# RegiChess

This is a personal project trying to create a chess game where you actually have to capture the opponent king in order to win the game.
Initially to be played just offline (plans to use socket in a near future). It's being developed with ports and adaptors architecture, Vite, TypeScript and React.

My main goal with this project is to learn more about the Ports and adaptors architecture, work my logic trying to get all chess rules, and have fun playing it, 'cause I love chess :)
